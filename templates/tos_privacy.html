        This combined page is for convenience. These documents may change over time; we’ll post updates here
        with a new “Last updated” date. If you use ChequeMatez after changes take effect, you agree to the updated terms.

    <!-- TERMS -->
    <section id="terms" aria-labelledby="terms-title">
      <h2 id="terms-title">Terms of Service</h2>

      <h3>1) Agreement to Terms</h3>

      </p>

      <h3>2) Who We Are</h3>
      <p>
        ChequeMatez (“we”, “us”) provides a platform to facilitate exchange, payouts and related value transfer
        workflows (e.g., mobile money such as M-Pesa, bank transfers, and phone-based transfers like WAMD).
        We are not a bank. Some Services may be provided via third-party partners.
      </p>

      <h3>3) Eligibility & Compliance</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>You must be at least the age of majority in your jurisdiction and capable of forming a binding contract.</li>
        <li>You agree to comply with all applicable laws, including AML/CFT, KYC, and sanctions requirements.</li>
        <li>We may require identity verification (KYC) and may suspend or terminate access if verification fails or risks are detected.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4) Accounts</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>You’re responsible for your account, credentials, and all activity under it.</li>
        <li>Provide accurate information and keep it up to date.</li>
        <li>We may restrict, suspend, or close accounts to manage risk or comply with law/policy.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>5) Fees, Rates & Settlement</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Fees and FX rates are shown in-app or at checkout; they may change at any time.</li>
        <li>Settlement timelines depend on networks and partners; delays may occur outside our control.</li>
        <li>Reversals, chargebacks, or compliance reviews can impact delivery or require additional documentation.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>6) Acceptable Use</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>No unlawful, fraudulent, deceptive, or abusive activity.</li>
        <li>No activity involving sanctioned persons, prohibited jurisdictions, or restricted industries.</li>
        <li>We can block transactions, report to authorities/partners, or close accounts to mitigate risk.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>7) Third-Party Services</h3>
      <p>
        Some features rely on third parties (e.g., mobile money operators, banks). Their terms and privacy apply in
        addition to ours. We are not responsible for their acts or omissions.
      </p>

      <h3>8) Disclaimers</h3>
      <p>
        The Services are provided “as is” and “as available.” To the fullest extent permitted by law, we disclaim all
        warranties, express or implied (including merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement).
      </p>

      <h3>9) Limitation of Liability</h3>
      <p>
        To the fullest extent permitted by law, ChequeMatez and its affiliates will not be liable for any indirect,
        incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits, revenue, data, or use.
        Our aggregate liability relating to the Services will not exceed the fees you paid to us in the 3 months
        preceding the event giving rise to the claim.
      </p>

      <h3>10) Indemnity</h3>
      <p>
        You agree to indemnify and hold ChequeMatez harmless from claims, damages, losses, and expenses (including
        reasonable legal fees) arising from your use of the Services, violation of these Terms, or violation of law.
      </p>

      <h3>11) Suspension & Termination</h3>
      <p>
        We may suspend or terminate access immediately for any reason, including suspected fraud, non-compliance,
        operational risk, or legal requests. You may close your account at any time unless restricted by law or
        an ongoing review.
      </p>

      <h3>12) Changes to Terms</h3>
      <p>
        We may update these Terms from time to time. Changes take effect when posted unless otherwise stated.
        Continued use after changes means you accept the updated Terms.
      </p>

      <h3>13) Governing Law & Disputes</h3>
      <p>
        These Terms are governed by the laws of our operating jurisdiction (to be specified in your local version).
        Any disputes will be resolved in that jurisdiction’s courts, unless mandatory law says otherwise.
      </p>
